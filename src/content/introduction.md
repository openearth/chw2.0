The [Coastal Hazard Wheel (CHW)](http://www.coastalhazardwheel.org/) is a universal coastal adaptation support system for use at local, regional and national level. The Coastal Hazard Wheel App is an automated application using the CHW which can be used for classifying a particular coastal location, determining its hazard profile, identifying relevant management options and communicating coastal information.

### How does it work?
The Coastal Hazard Wheel App currently provides global coastal classification data in low-moderate quality and focuses on erosion hazards. High quality national classifications and the full range of hazard types will become gradually available as various classification projects are implemented. The Coastal Hazard Wheel App uses six geo-biophysical classification layers, namely:

* Geological layout
* Wave exposure
* Tidal range
* Vegetation
* Sediment balance
* Storm climate


A combination of these variables returns a unique coastal environment that has a hazard level between 1 (low) and 4 (very high) for each hazard type. The hazard level is a general indication of the hazard presence in that coastal environment. The risk assessment is not part of the CHW and is added to give meaning to the hazard. It is a general indication of the risk in the area.

The Coastal Hazard Wheel App can be used for classifying coastal locations worldwide and producing hazard maps for the hazards of ecosystem disruption, gradual inundation, salt water intrusion, erosion and flooding under the projected climate change. It is an automated version of the Coastal Hazard Wheel based on global datasets.

In the COASTAL CLASSIFICATION tab, you can classify a specific coastal location, determine its hazard profile and obtain an overview of relevant management measures. This is done by marking a point in the sea at the coastal location to classified.

In the MAPPING tab, you can produce hazard maps for the five hazard types by turning on the specific hazard layers in the menu to the left. It is also possible to display information on capital values on land, population density and relevant background data.
